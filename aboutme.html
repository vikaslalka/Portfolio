            <h2>Hi There! Welcome to my Webpage
            </h2>
            <h3>This web page contains summary about my life and journey</h3>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            <p>This all starts being born in a middle class family in india.
                When I was young always I was reminded of one thing that for me to be successful 
                I need to become either an engineer or a doctor.

            </p>
            <br/>

            <p2>Preparing for the toughest and most competitive engineering exam in the world I guess 
                I forgot to explore my to all options but it wasn't that bad. I still shined through my high 
                school doing well in my studies and extra curricular activities.<br/> I was made the Basketball ball 
                Captian of my school team and also the Head Guitarist of my musical team giving out many stage performances
                my high school functions. I was exceptional in sports to winning most of the titles in my inter school athelectics programs.
            </p2>
<br/><br/>
            <p3>Now, After high school I decided to move abroad for a better education and to explore more options for me. 
                <br/> Struggles a few days to get settled in and to aquire knowledge about how the education system works here and to be honest 
                it is quite good gets us to do more practical work than just theoritical. 
            </p3>
            <br/><br/>
            <p4>Since, I started doing more practical work I became more and more indulge in the programming world 
                and my progress to become a better programmer.<br/>
                I have now worked on several college and freelance projects for some of my friends I think I am ready to set 
                a foot in the world of real field. Trying to get a job gain some actual experience.
